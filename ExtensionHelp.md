# Help using the browser extension
## Install the plugin
Download the plugin from my dropbox - https://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=netflix_channel-1.0.4-fx.xpi - or this repo. Open the file, specifying Firefox as the program to open the XPI file with. Alternatively, dragging the file to the browser should also work.

## Navigate to Netflix via the website, find a show to watch
Just as the title says, the plugin can only add shows to it's playlist. Find something to watch.

## Click the button for the extension in the top toolbar
Click the plugin button in the top toolbar for the newly installed plugin.

## Add the show to your playlist
Click the **Add to playlist** to add the show to your playlist. Keep in mind, you are adding the specific episode if it is a show. You are able to create playlists with a shows content out of order, specifying an alternate watch order. You can also mix and match your favorite shows into a single playlist.

## Navigate to another show
Click one of the **Next/Prev/Random** buttons once you have shows added to your playlist. 

## Export your playlist
When you have a playlist that you want to share, grab the base 64 text toward the bottom of the popup. Another user of the plugin can import that to have the same playlist as you.
